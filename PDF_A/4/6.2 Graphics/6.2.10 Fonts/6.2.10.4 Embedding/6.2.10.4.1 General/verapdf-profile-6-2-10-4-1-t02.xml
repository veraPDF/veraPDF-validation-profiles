        <description>Embedded fonts shall define all glyphs referenced for rendering within the conforming file.
            A font referenced for use solely in rendering mode 3 is therefore not rendered and is thus exempt
            from the embedding requirement. In all cases for TrueType fonts that are to be rendered, character codes
            shall be able to be mapped to glyphs according to ISO 32000-2:2020, 9.6.5 without the use of
            a non-standard mapping chosen by the conforming processor.</description>
