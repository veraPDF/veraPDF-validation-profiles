        <description>Embedded fonts shall define all glyphs referenced for rendering within the conforming file.
            A font referenced solely in text rendering mode 3 is not rendered and is thus exempt from the requirements
            that impact the visual representation of the glyphs of a font. In all cases for TrueType fonts that are to
            be rendered, character codes shall be able to be mapped to glyphs in accordance with ISO 32000-2:2020, 9.6.5,
            without the use of a non-standard mapping chosen by the conforming processor</description>
