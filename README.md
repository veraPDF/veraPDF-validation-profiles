# veraPDF validation profiles

The repository contains all validation profiles supported by veraPDF. They are split into individual rules and then grouped into validation profiles for each supported flavor.

The [PDF_A](https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-validation-profiles/tree/integration/PDF_A) folder contains all rules for PDF/A validation against all PDF/A parts (ISO 19005) and conformance levels.  

The [PDF_UA](https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-validation-profiles/tree/integration/PDF_UA) folder holds all rules and validation profiles for PDF/UA-1, PDF/UA-2 and WTPDF 1.0 validation, as well as validation of parent-child relationships in Tagged PDF structure tree for ISO 32000-1, ISO 32000-2 and ISO 32005. Finally, this folder also contains rules and validation profiles for WCAG 2.2. This is work in progress and is in the experimental stage. 

See [Wiki pages](https://github.com/veraPDF/veraPDF-validation-profiles/wiki) for the documentation on the profile syntax and the details for each rule.
